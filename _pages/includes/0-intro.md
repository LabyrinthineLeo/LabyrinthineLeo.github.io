I am a third-year Ph.D student at Anhui University (AHU), and supervised by Prof. Xingyi Zhang. My research interests include Graph-based Recommendation, Fiarness-ware User Modeling, and Self-supervised Learning. I have published several papers in leading journals and conferences, such as IEEE TKDE, IEEE TBD, KDD, SIGIR, ACM Multimedia, and IJCAI.

I am looking for a Postdoc position in the ML and DM area, please feel free to contact me! (yyh.hfut@gmail.com)
